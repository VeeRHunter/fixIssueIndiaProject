Issues of the ionic project

1.Transitions between all login screens is not smooth or consistent still when clicking on the green bar!!. 
Not too bad from the keyboard- If they don’t get what I mean, An example of smooth transition for login screens is sharecare.
Also, why is there only a cursor when where a user enter their email and not password).

2.When choosing to show an item on your profile page its does let me uncheck. iPhone X working.
iPhonwe 6 and 6s not working.

3.App froze during testing again refer to images. 
Remained frozen after force quitting. Had to reinstall again.

4.ANDROID ISSUES - Freezing after entering password (Oppo phone) See images.

5.Password screen doesn’t work at all when pressing on green bar only with keyboard..then when you click the keyboard it wipes out the password.

6.Transition is not good it jerks up and down when using green bar.

7.From a profile page, clicking back to settings, the screen moves right instead of left like other screens.

8.There’s still a cursor on email login but nothing on password login, has to be consistent, either or not!!.
Cant those two screens have exactly the same design as new login? Which has an X and > to move to the next screen.
